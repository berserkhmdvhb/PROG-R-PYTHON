# predict-biological-age
Py-ML Project to predict biological age from health data

### Tasks:

- Explore the variable space of training and (real) test data, write down your observation for each variable
- Build at least 3 models to predict the Biological age
  - 1 Linear/KNN/SVM
  - 1 Decision Tree
  - 1 Ensemble
- Tune and cross validate those models
- Choose the most optimised model from those (Adjusted <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> metric)
- Predict Biological age for the individuals in the real test data with that chosen model
